# Google Student Training in Engineering Program

This repo contains the projects I will work on for the first half of STEP.
This work is based on the [Google Software Product Sprint](https://g.co/softwareproductsprint) program.

There are three branches:
* master - the main branch which contains the latest working version
* develop - the branch where magic happens
* review - made to have pull requests to it
